# Abstract classes
## 5 minute intro.
1. "Placeholder" class that has some pieces missing that children need to provide.
2. A class that cannot be used to instantiate objects. A concrete class must extend it and implement it's method in order to be able to create objects.
3. Use the `abstract` keyword to denote the class is abstract.
4. Use the `abstract` keyword to denote the methods that are abstract (have no implementation). BUT you can have no-abstract methods in an abstract class.
5. Use the `extends` keyword to extend the abstract class and provide a concrete implementation.
