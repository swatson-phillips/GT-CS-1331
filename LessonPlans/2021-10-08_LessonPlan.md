# Abstract classes
## 5 minute intro. (see slides)
1. "Placeholder" class that has some pieces missing that children need to provide.
2. A class that cannot be used to instantiate objects. A concrete class must extend it and implement it's method in order to be able to create objects.
3. Use the `abstract` keyword to denote the class is abstract.
4. Use the `abstract` keyword to denote the methods that are abstract (have no implementation). BUT you can have no-abstract methods in an abstract class.
5. Use the `extends` keyword to extend the abstract class and provide a concrete implementation.


## Activity
- Discussion of different games and the fields (properties) and behaviors (methods) thye might have.
- Instances of a game with field values vs. Different types of game classes. (e.g. Monopoly versions)
- Implement an abstract class called `Game` that contains fields and methods common to all games
- Implement at least 1 concrete child class of `Game` that implements the `abstract` methods 
- Your child class can also add additional methods and fields.
- Write a **driver class** that utilizes the Game and child class.

Activity based on the physical games: Monopoly, Sorry and Dominos shown in class. But you can use whatever games you like.
