# Topics: Class design and interaction, Wrapper Classes, Inheritance

---

# Class design and interaction
- Let's continue to look at the Zoo example
- Try out the "Class Communication" problem given in the outline it is good practice

# Wrapper Classes (5 min summary)
- Classes the represent each of the primitive types
- Have methods and fields to do things more easily
- Auto boxing and auto-unboxing and the problems that can happen (example)

# Class design and interaction
- Zoo example
- Try out the "Class Communication" problem given in the outline before the next lecture

# Inheritance
- process of defining/deriving new classes from existing ones. A sub-class automatically contains some or all of the methods and data of the original (parent) class but can also add new ones
- The keyword to indicate that a child class extends (is a child of) a parent is **extends**
- The relationship can be expressed as a “is a” hierarchy; for example, Square is a Shape, *Circle* **is a** *Shape*
- Access
-super keyword and constructor chaining
-single vs Multiple inheritance and what Java is
