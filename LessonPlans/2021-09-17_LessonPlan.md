# Topics: ARRAYS and Classes

# Arrays
## What are arrays?
- data structure that is a **fixed-size** that holds elements of the same data type
- **object!!!**
- a variable of an array type holds an object reference, what are the implications of this?

## Working with arrays
- Size: getting the length of an array (.length - not a method unlike String.length())
- Java does auto bounds checking (this is different than C) to prevent accessing memory outside of the bounds of the array. Instead you can get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at Runtime.
- declaring an array
- initializing an array
- assigning values to the array elements
- iterating over an array
    - for loop
    - for-each loop (enhanced for loop)
- Arrays are objects, what happens if you pass an array variable as a parameter to a method? Can you change the elements in the array?
- Can you resize an array?
- Command line arguments


## Multidimensional arrays
- look at the outline or textbook chapter 8
