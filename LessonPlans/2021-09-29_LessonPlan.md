# Topics: Encapsulation and Constructors

# Copy Constructors
- Why have copy constructors
- shallow vs deep copy constructors
- What if your class has instance data the references another object?
- Let's look at the `UnicornFarm.java` example and finish the example
- [Shallow vs. Deep Copy in Java tutorial](https://dzone.com/articles/java-copy-shallow-vs-deep-in-which-you-will-swim)

# `null` and NPE
- `null` is a literal value that represents the absence of a reference value
- this is the default when a variable that holds an object reference has not been initialize (doesn't point to any object)
- If you try to "deference" a variable that holds a null value, you can end up with a `NullPointerException`
- The `NullPointerException` is a Runtime exception that can cause your program to crash.
- Let's look at an example...

# Class design and interaction
- Zoo example
- Try out the "Class Communication" problem given in the outline before the next lecture

# Wrapper classes
