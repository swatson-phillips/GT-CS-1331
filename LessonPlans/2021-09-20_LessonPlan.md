# Topics: Classes and Encapsulation
---
# Classes
## Defining a class & creating objects (9.1-9.3)
- We've been creating classes, but why?
- Classes have attributes (fields) and behavior (methods)
- Creating objects (new keyword) and the memory model

## instance data (9.5)
- also called fields
- belongs a particular object
- automatically initialized with defaults for the data type:

## instance methods
- variable scope (9.13)
- overloading (6.8) - same as with static methods
- What can you use from what context and how?
## **encapsulation**
- getters and setters (9.9)
- enforcing encapsulation w/ visibility modifiers: (public and private) (9.8)
