1331 Day 6 9/03/21 Lesson Plan

Announcements:
    * PE 2 released
    * Participation activity today
    * Bring your laptop one day before our exam to test it out

Topics: Program Control Flow
=> Conditionals
    * (review)if, else if, else (3.3-3.6) - Conditionals.java
        ** the else gets matched with the closes if above when there aren't {}
    * ternary(3.14) - TernaryExample.java
    * switch (3.13) - ChineseZodiac.java & SwitchDemo.java
=> Iteration (5)
    * while loop
    * do-while loop
    * for loop
    * continue and break: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/branch.html
        * break - used to terminate a for, while, or do-while loop, often combined with conditional if. Does not re-evaluate the boolean-expression of the loop.
        * continue - skips the remainder of a for, while , or do-while loop and re-evaluated the boolean-expression of the loop.
    * Pitfalls:
        * Caution: watch for stray ; (semi-colon) after the closing parenthesis in for loop
        * Incorrectly incrementing or decrementing a control variable
        * Infinite loops
--- Stopped here 9/3/21 ---
    * conversion between types to loops
